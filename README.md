# Interactive card details form solution

This project was created using Vite.js, a fast and modern build tool for web projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to use the following scripts:

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run dev
```
This command starts a local development server with hot module replacement, allowing you to see your changes in real-time as you edit your code.
### Build for Production

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run dev
```
This command bundles your application into static files for production. It optimizes the output for the best performance.
### Preview Production Build

To start the development server, run:
```
pnpm run dev
```
This command serves the files generated from the build command locally, allowing you to inspect the production build and ensure it works as expected before deploying.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
  
### What I learned

I learned to use the Tailwind CSS framework by using different types of classes to make the site responsive, using the "mobile first" approach.

Example of Tailwind CSS classes in HTML:

```html-Tailwind CSS
<h1 font-grot text-[9px] leading-[11px] tracking-[1.28px] font-medium laptop:font-grot laptop:text-[14px] laptop:leading-[18px] laptop:tracking-[2px] laptop:font-medium">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
Example of a JavaScript event listener:
```js
buttonEventClic.addEventListener("click", clickConfirm);
```

### Continued development

My focus is on continuing to develop in JavaScript along with technologies such as React.js and TypeScript.
